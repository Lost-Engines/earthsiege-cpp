# Implementation record

The native game is being built from the supplied Earthsiege 1.0 data and original-code comparisons in `../earthsiege-reverse`. Original x86 execution is confined to the research tools; the game and C++ tests use native implementations and recorded fixtures.

Working components:

- All seven original VOL archives, bounded resource lookup and independent payload checks.
- Indexed artwork, VGA palettes/shade ramps and DFN fonts; native 320×200 software framebuffer and square-pixel SDL2 window.
- Original main-menu artwork, dialog text/hitboxes, three-state button styles and caption plaque. Actions other than exit are still being integrated.
- Original 56-word additive random generator, including signed bounds and wrapping seed warm-up.
- Source-mission compilation: conditions, late variant binding, coordinate sums, partial merges and reference remapping. All nine output tables and final RNG state agree with 300 original compiler cases under four explicit campaign/RNG states.
- Typed compiled mission handoff: points, headings, routes, areas, triggers, HERCs, flyers, fixed ground objects and groups. All nine tables match captured native in-memory records in 300 cases.
- Complete mission briefing/objective/debrief decoding, with counter-selected phrases matching 2,223 original interpreter results.
- Original BSP painter traversal, projected-size detail selection and cell-animation selection; 28,632 original child-render traces agree.
- Fixed-point Euler matrices and point/vector/plane transforms, with 2,141 original-code comparisons. Original cosine-table rounding is preserved.
- Typed 3Space meshes, materials, BSP trees, detail levels, cell animations, articulated poses and collision heightfields. All 47,575 objects in 44 resources agree with original-reader fingerprints across 23 field groups.
- Independent model instances with zeroed cell state, default poses and incremental hierarchical transforms. All 5,236 original default/blended pose references agree; stored cell cycle counts are distinct from live frame indices.
- Queued animation channels with signed playback rates, authored transition search, stop-on-arrival, reverse stepping and accumulated/interpolated root motion. 8,955 original traces (98,505 transition states) and 5,120 root-motion samples agree. Requests currently select any destination frame, matching ordinary HERC consumers.
- Native ambient, directional and positional lighting, object-space light transforms and the original ten-light list. All 16,896 original intensity calculations and 512 transformed lights agree, including different model/terrain incidence rules and fixed-point wrapping.
- Four bundled original demo starting states and their 9,300 input frames. Replay simulation is not implemented yet.

Next work proceeds through mission placement, 3Space software rendering and animation, HERC movement/collision/weapons, AI and mission rules, cockpit and shell/campaign integration, then complete sound/presentation playback. These remain implementation work; the current menu is not a playable game.

Some retained handoff fields have provisional names (`argument`, `initial_value`, `extra`, numbered trigger links) until their original consumers establish their roles. Tests compare their exact values regardless of naming. The original handoff writer does not truncate reused files, so the parser deliberately accepts stale trailing bytes after its declared tables.

`tools/export_mission_fixtures.py` refreshes reference fixtures from the research captures. `tests/fixtures/README.md` records the source routines and controlled campaign/RNG states. Do not treat zero campaign flags or the fixtures' arbitrary RNG state as a new campaign's real initial state.
